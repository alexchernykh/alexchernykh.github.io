      <description>I created my portfolio website using Hugo and UIKit, it serves as an online resume containing all my work.
This has been created as a theme so that others can use and adapt it.
Sections Homepage The homepage provides the basic information about you, including links to social media, skills you have, things you&amp;rsquo;ve done and your education. This page makes good use of UIKit grid and cards for organising all the information and ensuring it is responsive to work on mobile devices.</description>

      <description>Here i can post smth in Markdown
Why Hugo? The first question is why a site builder? I&amp;rsquo;m competent at web development, why not just write it all myself? The markdown processing makes it much easier to just write words, not having to think about the formatting, and if I&amp;rsquo;m going to blog often, then I&amp;rsquo;ll need that.
Next it gets to why Hugo? why not Jekyll or any of the other vast array of site builders?</description>
